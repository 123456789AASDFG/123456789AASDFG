❤Strategy

“Ask first. Before jumping into designing I always make sure that I'am asking the right questions and trying to accomplish the right challenges. This stage includes market research, competitive analyses, consulting and exploring possible solutions.”

❤Design

“Problem solving. At the end of this phase you’ll have a pixel perfect design for your app or website. During the transition from wireframes into the final design I create prototypes simulating final end results before development.”

❤Development

“Bringing designs to life. Since I’m a full stack developer, I can easily work in close collaboration with developers up until the finish line and beyond. In case of web projects I also do blockchain development.”

❤Quality assurance
